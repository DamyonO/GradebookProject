# GradebookProject
 
This Gradebook project was completed at Clemson University during the Intro to Software Development class.
The project allows a user to manipulate and work with a gradebook connected to a AWS database using MySQL.
The user can add, remove, and edit variables such as Tests, Quizes, and Projects.

Other functions such as computing the average grade for the class are implimented within the CLI.

# THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL AND SERVES PURELY AS A REFERENCE POINT
